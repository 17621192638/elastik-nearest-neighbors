# Elasticsearch-Aknn Benchmarks

This directory contains code for benchmarking an Elasticsearch-Aknn installation
using Glove word vectors.

The `aknn.py` script should give an idea for how to programatically interact
with the Elasticsearch-Aknn plugin.

The `figures.ipynb` notebook should give some ideas on performance for various
configurations.
